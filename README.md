FFR: Forked For Reference
This is one of several repos I've found while searching across the web for help with various technical hurdles. Sometimes I come across a repo that's so good that I'm going to preserve it in my own account for future reference (FFR, forked for reference, filed for reference, for future reference)
#
How I found it: I came across this repo while searching for information on spatial autocorrelation, then found other great repos by mgimond.  
Why: I don't use ArcGIS much these days, both due to work and mostly working on linux platforms, so this is a good JIC reference.
